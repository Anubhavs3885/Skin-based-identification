# Skin-based-identification
A dataset is given of rgb images in the google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eanpLsy9J0DpQA7Cx0QNaUSC2-zGYVEg?usp=drive_link
extract the dataset, keep the Hands folder and HandInfo.xlsx file in same location use the code in datasetcreate.py to create the dataset,
use the created dataset with main.py to get the results of the classification.
main2.py will give slightly better results
There is also a smaller dataset for lower compatibilty requirements. In the drive this dataset is not zipped one can use it as it is.
